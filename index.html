            <p>Hello Gabriel Schmidt! It's great to learn more about you. It sounds like you have a diverse range of interests and activities in your life. Studying web development at BYU Pathway and pursuing a private pilot course near your home show a strong commitment to both technology and aviation.

                Your enthusiasm for discovering new things is admirable, and it seems like you make the most of your free time by engaging in various activities like watching movies, running at Parque do Sábia, playing volleyball, and exploring waterfalls. Maintaining a balance between your studies and these recreational pursuits is essential for a well-rounded lifestyle.
                
                It's interesting to see your diverse music taste, from acoustic rap to funk and pop songs. Music can certainly add a lot of flavor to different moments in life.
                
                Best of luck with your web development studies, pilot course, and all your future endeavors! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. Before I forget, my favorite food at all is Brazilian Barbecue of course.</p>
